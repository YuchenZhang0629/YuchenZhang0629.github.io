title: Blog0 - Creating personal site, plotting a linear regression
---
#### This is my first ever post on my personal site! In this activity I did some brief reviews on importing packages, string manipulation and creation of random arrays. Besides, I got everything set up for my personal blog, and successfully imported the plot to cap it off. Not bad for a start!

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as plt
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
```


```python
rand_data = pd.read_csv("df.csv")
x_val = rand_data["x_val"]
x_val = pd.DataFrame(x_val)
y_val = rand_data["y"]
regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(x_val, y_val)
```




    LinearRegression()




```python
plt.scatter(x_val, y_val)
plt.scatter(x_val, x_val*regr.coef_[0], color = "red")
```

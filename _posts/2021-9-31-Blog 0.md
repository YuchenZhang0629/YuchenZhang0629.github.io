title: Blog0 - Creating personal site and plotting a linear regression
---

### Part1: Introduction
##### This is my first ever post on my personal site! In this activity I did some brief reviews on importing packages, string manipulation and creation of random arrays. Besides, I got everything set up for my personal blog, and successfully imported the plot to cap it off. Not bad for a start!
```python
# Importing the necessary functions
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
```

### Part2: Reading and fitting the data
##### First, I constructed a dataset by adding random noise to a linear model. Then, I read the dataframe into Jupyter Notebook, pulled the LinearRegression package, and tried to construct a model that fits the scatterplot to see how well it corresponds to the model I used to create the dataset.
```python
rand_data = pd.read_csv("df.csv")
x_val = rand_data["x_vals"]
# Since linear regression in python accepts a dataframe, I have to convert it
x_val = pd.DataFrame(x_val)
y_val = rand_data["y_vals"]
"""
Knowing that there is a positive correlation between x and y, I 
decide to fit a linear model on it.
"""
regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(x_val, y_val)
```

```python
"""
The actual slope is 0.4, and here the linear model gives 0.38, which is very close to the actual value I used to construct it.
The actual intercept is 20, and the model gives a relatively close value as well, which is 21.28
"""
regr.coef_[0]
regr.intercept_
```
0.37872464441122594
21.281740179491685


### Part3: Plotting the data and the model
##### After extracting the slope and intercept of the linear model, I was able to plot the linear regression on top of the scatterplot. As we could see, it captures the overall trend pretty well.
```python
plt.scatter(x_val, y_val)
"""
The coef_[0] value is be very close but not equal to the actual
slope variable that I used to create the dataset
"""
plt.scatter(x_val, x_val*regr.coef_[0] + regr.intercept_, color = "red")
plt.title("Fitting linear model on scatterplot")
plt.xlabel("X values")
plt.ylabel("Y values")
```

### Part3: Conclusion
##### So this will be it for my first blog post. I did some reviews on basic data manipulations and moedlling techniques. Otherwise, until next time!
